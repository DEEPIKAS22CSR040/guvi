KUBVERNETES(K8s)
kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment,scaling,and mangagement of containerized applications.
 the open source project is hosted by the cloud native computing foundation.

Kubernetes developed by google.

KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE
pod-group of running container.

orchestration-all the images will be running in different ports to run all the images which were running in different port can be made to run in single
port number by doing orchestration.

in kubernetes architecture we have master and slave,
MASTER-controller of every slave nodes.
MASTER CONTAINS FOLLOWING THINGS WHICH ARE USED FOR CONNECTING SLAVE NODES
	api server-it is the central control point for all interactions with the cluster.
	scheduler-it is responsible for assigning workloads(pods) to individual worker nodes based on resource requirements.
	controller-manager-it uns variouus controllers that monitor the cluster state.
	etcd-it is a distributed key value store used by kubernetes to store cluster state and configuration data.
SLAVE NODE CONTAINS
	containers
	docker 
	kubectl

MASTER NODE
	tHE CONTROL PLANE'S COMPONENTS MAKE GLOBAL DECISIONS ABOUT THE CLUSTER AS WELL AS DETECTING AND RESPONDING TO CLUSTER EVENTS

WORKER NODE
 contains many things some of them are
	POD - it is basic units of deployment in kubernetes. it is running image in the container,
	REPLICA SET- it ensures a specified  number of pod replicas are running at all times.
	DEPLOYMENT- a higher level abstraction that manages and updates a set of replica pods.
	SERVICE-A service provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a group of pods.
